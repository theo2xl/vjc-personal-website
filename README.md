# Personal Website
This is the complete source for my personal website - a simple angular application with some bootstrap on top. It's a little bit hacked together at the moment, but enjoy!
Built with https://github.com/angular/angular-seed and http://startbootstrap.com/ and the grayscale template.

## Getting Started
The easiest way to get this setup would be to follow the README from https://github.com/angular/angular-seed .
